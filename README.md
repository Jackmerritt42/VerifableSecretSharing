WIP towards a rework on my SSS with DKG. I was thinking about it one night, and if the dealer just gives out malicious, incorrect shares, there would be no way of knowing without testing them. this implementation of  Feldman’s Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) will create a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Secret Sharing Protocol. It mathematically guarantees that a share is valid before any secret reconstruction takes place, preventing a malicious dealer from corrupting the pool.
